* Rename the main output directory from "Output_JCI_Schwann_enrichment" to "Output_JCI"
* A new subdirectory "Enrichment_Analysis" should be created within "Output_JCI"
* the enrichment subdirectories ending with "_enrichment" should be created within this "Enrichment_Analysis" folder; therefore, "Output_JCI/Enrichment_Analysis/"
* I don't want to use clusterProfiler for enrichment analysis. Just use richR only.
