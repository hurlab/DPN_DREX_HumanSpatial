* Rename the main output directory from "Output_JCI_Schwann_enrichment" to "Output_JCI"
* Let's use the following dataset name. Mouse, JCI_SC, and JCI_Bulk, when possible, especially in Venn diagrams.
* A new subdirectory "Enrichment_Analysis" should be created within "Output_JCI"
* the enrichment subdirectories ending with "_enrichment" should be created within this "Enrichment_Analysis" folder; therefore, "Output_JCI/Enrichment_Analysis/"
* Do not clusterProfiler for enrichment analysis. Just use richR only.
* For cell type, let's use (c("mySC", "nmSC", "ImmSC", "majorSC")): The first three are from DEG and the last one is from DEG_Major folder. As the name suggests, majorSC include all three SC cells. Let's use these four cell types in our analysis. Do not include SC3
* For comparison groups, let's use c("HFDvsSD", "DRvsHFD", "EXvsHFD", "DREXvsHFD")
* In "CellType_Comparison", I only see "majorSC" and "mySC" but missing cell types 
* According to the run summary, KEGG analysis using richR failed. I need to know exactly why it failed.
